# Personal-Website
A personal website created using HTML, CSS, Javascript (Jquery) and Python’s Django framework. This website has been redesigned from the original version made during my third semester at university (2018).

The original website contains several small apps in it, such as a book-searcher using Google’s API, a status-maker, a scheduler (a create-event feature), and includes user authentication. 
This updated version is a redesigned version of the original website - some of the features may have be removed.
