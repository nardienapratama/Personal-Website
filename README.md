    # Personal-Website
    This is a fork of a personal website project I made two years ago on Gitlab. This repository is made for the revamp of the website.
    The website has links to different apps, as shown below. The website has been developed in Python using the Django framework for the back-end; HTML, CSS, Javascript (with JQuery) for the front-end.
